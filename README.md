## Overview

The Movies App is a Flutter application that leverages [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to provide information about popular movies, top-rated movies, and user-selected favorites. The app features a user-friendly interface with two main screens: the home screen and the details screen.

## Features

- **Home Screen:**
    - Displays popular movies, top-rated movies, and user-selected favorites.
    - Allows users to switch between categories seamlessly.

- **Details Screen:**
    - Provides detailed information about a selected movie.
    - Includes movie title, release date, overview, and more.
